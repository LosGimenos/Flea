### Project MVP
CRUD app allowing users to upload items or services for sale that other users can view and bid on.
MVP allows users to: 
* register accounts
* login 
* post a text version of a product or service
* view products and services for sale by category  

### Technologies
* React, React-Router
* CSS
* NPM
* Firebase
* Webpack
* Babel

### Next Steps
Finding a way to sort products and services by type as well as establishing a profile for each user that will store their bids and items for sale for quick reference. I think I can use a params or some such to attach a unique ID to both listings and bids as they are created. 

### Bonuses
Easy Bonus:
* Allow users to upload photos of their product.
Xanadu level fantasy land how's it going Ricardo Montalban:
* I would actually love to have most of this activity processed via SMS. You are notified when something matching some keywords is listed and you can bid on it through SMS. Likewise you can list something via SMS. In this version I would need to add superagent and operate through the Twilio API or some other nonsense. Again, look boss...the plane...
